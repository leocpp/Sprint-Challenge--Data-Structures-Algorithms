Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

1.
a) O(n)
b) O(log(n))
c) O(n^2)
d) O(n^2)
e) O(n^3)
f) O(n)
g) O(n)


2.
a) 
b) divide and conquer, start from n/2 middle and either go up or down by half the previous change, e.g (n/2)/2 next, until the egg does not break

3.
a) O(n^2) worst case. because there is no partition, i.e. you have to traverse the entire list from beginning to end each time for each element.

b) O(n log n). best case.   the list would be partition evenly to begin with.
